We need to start monitoring the system if possible while performing our enumeration...
In other words:
"S1REN... Is privilege escalation going to come from some I/O file operations being done by some script on the system?"
https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/blob/master/README.md
cd /var/tmp/
File Transfer --> pspy32
File Transfer --> pspy64
chmod 755 pspy32 pspy64
./pspy<32/64>

What does the local network look like?
netstat -antup
netstat -tunlp

Is anything vulnerable running as root?
ps aux |grep -i 'root' --color=auto

MYSQL Credentials? Root Unauthorized Access?
mysql -uroot -p
Enter Password:
root : root
root : toor
root :

S1REN would take a quick look at etc to see if any user-level people did special things:
cd /etc/
ls -lsaht
Anything other than root here?
• Any config files left behind?
→ ls -lsaht |grep -i ‘.conf’ --color=auto

• If we have root priv information disclosure - are there any .secret in /etc/ files?
→ ls -lsaht |grep -i ‘.secret’ --color=aut

SSH Keys I can use perhaps for even further compromise?
ls -lsaR /home/

Quick look in:
ls -lsaht /var/lib/
ls -lsaht /var/db/

Quick look in:
ls -lsaht /opt/
ls -lsaht /tmp/
ls -lsaht /var/tmp/
ls -lsaht /dev/shm/
